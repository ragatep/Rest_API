Teamtreehouse - Project 9<br />
REST API

I built this REST API using Express, the back-end section of a two-part project full-stack JavaSctip application. This API demonstrates a way to administer a school database with information about users and courses by interacting with the database using CRUD operations. The API allows users to create a new login account or retrieve existing account information.

In this project, I used my knowledge of Node.js, Express, REST API, and Sequelize. Part two is the front-end client section that uses this REST API.
